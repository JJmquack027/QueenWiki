                <p>Sheer Heart Attack is the third studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 8 November

                    from the progressive themes featured on their first two albums, the album featured more pop-centric
                    and conventional rock tracks and marked a step towards the "classic" Queen sound. It was produced by
                    the band and Roy Thomas Baker, and launched Queen to mainstream popularity in the UK and throughout
                    the world.</p>

                    Thomas Baker, the album artwork was suggested by Roger Taylor, who previously saw a similar design
                    painted on the Berlin Wall. The album's varying musical styles were alternately praised and
                    criticised. It reached number two in the UK Albums Chart and number six on the US Billboard 200.</p>

                    "Flash". The album reached number 10 on the UK charts and number 23 in the US.</p>

                <p>Hot Space is the tenth studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was released on 21 May 1982 by
                    EMI Records in the UK and by Elektra Records in the US. Marking a notable shift in direction from
                    their earlier work, they employed many elements of disco, funk, rhythm, dance and pop music on the
                    album. This made the album less popular with fans who preferred the traditional rock style they had
                    come to associate with the band. Queen's decision to record a dance-oriented album germinated with
                    the massive success of their 1980 hit "Another One Bites the Dust" in both the UK and US.</p>

                <h2>The Works</h2>
                <p>The Works is the eleventh studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was released on 27 February
                    1984 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and it is the band's first studio album to be released by
                    Capitol Records in the United States. After the synth-heavy Hot Space (1982), the album saw the
                    re-emergence of Brian May and Roger Taylor's rock sound, while still incorporating the early 80s
                    retro futuristic electronic music (Freddie Mercury) and New York funk scenes (John Deacon). Recorded
                    at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles, California and Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany from
                    August 1983 to January 1984, the album's title comes from a comment Taylor made as recording began –
                    "Let's give them the works!".</p>

                <h2>The Miracle</h2>
                <p>The Miracle is the thirteenth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 22 May 1989 by
                    Parlophone Records and Capitol Records in both the United Kingdom and the USA, respectively, where
                    it was the band's first and final studio album to be released on those respective labels. The album
                    was recorded as the band recovered from Brian May's marital problems and Freddie Mercury's HIV
                    diagnosis in 1987 (which was known to the band, though not publicised at the time). Recording
                    started in January 1988 and lasted for an entire year. It was also the last Queen album with a photo
                    of the band on the front cover.</p>

                <p>Innuendo is the fourteenth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 4 February 1991

                    Hollywood Records in the United States. Produced by David Richards and the band, it was the band's
                    last album to be released in lead singer Freddie Mercury’s lifetime, and their most recent one to be
                    composed of entirely new material. It reached the No. 1 spot on the UK album charts and stayed at
                    that position for two weeks, and also peaked at No. 1 in Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, and
                    Switzerland, staying at No. 1 for three weeks, four weeks, six weeks, and eight weeks, respectively.
                    It was the first Queen album to go Gold in the US upon its release since The Works in 1984.</p>

            <h2>Made In Heaven</h2>
            <p>Made in Heaven is the fifteenth and final studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 6
                November 1995 by Parlophone Records in the United Kingdom and by Hollywood Records in the United States.
                It was the band's first and only release after the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury in 1991.
                Following Mercury's death, guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor, and bass guitarist John Deacon
                worked with vocal and piano parts that Mercury recorded before his death, adding new instrumentation to
                the recordings. Both stages of recording, before and after Mercury's death, were completed at the band's
                studio in Montreux, Switzerland. The album debuted at number 1 in the UK, where it went quadruple
                platinum selling 1.2 million copies. 500,000 copies were shipped in the United States.</p>
