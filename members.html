                <h2>Freddie Mercury</h2>
                <p>Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 â€“ 24 November 1991) was a British singer,
                    songwriter, record producer and the lead vocalist of the rock band Queen. Regarded as the
                    greatest singer in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and
                    four-octave vocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his theatrical
                    style, influencing the artistic direction of Queen.</p>
